# Laravel Valet /dist/ Driver

Custom `vue-cli-service serve` driver for [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet).

## What is this?

This is a custom driver to automatically run the server specified by `serve` in your `package.json scripts`.

To work effectively, this driver relies on the defaults provided by Vue CLI 3+.

## Installation

1. Copy `VueServeValetDriver.php into your ~/.valet/Drivers` directory.
2. Done :)
